Richard is a functional programmer who specializes in pushing the limits of browser-based UIs. He’s built seamless-immutable, a JavaScript immutables library that seamlessly interoperates with normal JS collections; elm-css, a CSS preprocessor where you write Elm instead of CSS; and Dreamwriter, a long-form writing Web App written in Elm which works like a desktop app in the absence of an Internet connection.
