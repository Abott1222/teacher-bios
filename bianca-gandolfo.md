Bianca is a JavaScript enthusiast currently working on the open source team at Bitovi. She likes to pretend she is coding away on the more important bits of the DoneJS framework in some hacker basement, but most of the time she is just writing documentation and fixing bugs near the beach. When she's not doing that, she practices getting sunburnt while wiping out repeatedly on a surfboard and writes JS curriculum for coding bootcamps around the world.
