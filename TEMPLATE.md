Johnny Appleseed is an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees to large parts of Pennsylvania, Ontario, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, as well as the northern counties of present-day West Virginia. He became an American legend, due to his kind, generous ways, his leadership in conservation, and the symbolic importance he attributed to apples.
